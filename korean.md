# Learning Korean 

A running journal of reflections while learning/relearning Korean. 

### 2022 Nov 22
- How to get the most of out language learning platforms 
   - Can it be a community if it's always asynchronous 
   - HelloTalk
      -  Mobile on ; nothing on the web
      -  Feels incredibly spammy; cant spend more than a few minutes in the app before I start getting hit with all sorts of banners and pop-ups about upgrading to VIP. 
      -  Pushing through, the UI feels pretty cluttered. What exactly am I doing here? 
         - I tried but stopped. Man this is terrible.     
   - **iTalki** community feels the lightest as if it were bolted on at the end. 
      - Not sure what to do with the feed
      - Topics for you (what is this again) - why for me? 
      - What do I have to say and why would I say it? 
   - Reddit - more about posts within a subreddit — it's the organizing unit of the service; not the person and the journey they're on. 
   - 
   - Kakao for language learning community?
   - 
   - A huge gap in temporary cohorting while learning something self-paced online — create something around this

### 2022 Nov 17
- Pro-tip when using Mochi — manually add words to review after iTalki lessons to force them into circulation. Easier this way since you can't just cram.
- [Why Korean sentences are challenging for learners (and what to do about it) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiWIdvcM21o).
   - Missing context (particles) 
   - Sentences are often flexible and sequenced
   - So have to think about what was missing 


### 2022 Nov 03
- Keep chipping away. Little by little.

### 2022 Sep 26
- Been a minute since I practiced Korean. Life "aka new kid". Trying to ease myself back in with baby steps: 
   - Reconnect with why I study Korean
   - Booking a few iTalki lessons with tutors as a forcing function to practice
   - Watching a few easy TTMIK videos on Youtube just for fun 
   - 
- I want to make sure that I don't burnout in my attempt to get back into a flow
- [Watch this video before you speak in Korean - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXhvTPXcCV4). Great ideas on how to warm up [your brain] on Korean because the context switch costing of jumping straight into talking with someone else can be very high.
   -  Pronunciation warm-up
   -  Setence reading
   -  Paragraphy reading
   -  Answering question


### 2022 Aug 08

- Learning quotations in Korean 
   -  In quoted sentences, the “quoted” part gets conjugated into the plain (or “diary”) form. 
   -  Then you append with `고`
   -  Can conjugate 
     -  the quoted form to indicate the tense of the quote
     -  the ending to indicate when the quote was spoken said
   -  Can use ~에게/한테/께 to the person being spoken to
   -  Can shorten 말하다 → 하다 since it's implied that this is being spoken



### 2022 Jul 19

- More thoughts on why language learning community is challenging 
  -  Appropriate mix of levels (otherwise blind leading the bling) 
  -  Connecting over more than just dogma (the challenge of communities built around language learning methods — the approach versus the goal)
  -  Lack of accessible content in the domains, subcultures you care about

### 2022 Jul 18
- Getting into rhythm with iTalki tutors have been great. It's given me something interactive and something to look it forward to in a way that's more than just focusing on immersion on and input

### 2022 Jul 16 

- Finding / creating a (Korean language learning) community is hard. 

### 2022 Jul 09 

Reminded of the importance to remember the vision when language learning. It's easy to get discouraged, distracted and it's importance to have something to hold onto, to movitate you to keep going when you're just grinding. Still looking for the best format to document my vision. To be continued. 

### 2022 Jul 08

Two places where I need to be mindful when learning languages — getting caught in theory / dogma and tools. [[Sometimes]] these two overlap. 

You end up learning about learning versus learning the language itself. How to best manage this? 

- Philosophy? → Keep fundamental principles in mind but be wary of the anyone who preaches their process too much (or brands it)
- Tools?  → Know your basic needs of a language learning tools and stick with tools that are light, flexible. Be careful of those that have incredible high learning curves or offer so many degrees of freedom that they are no longer opinionated (they are confused).

How to build a language learning community. Start a thread on this on twitter. Some of the challenges that I see (language level, motivation, interests), durability.

Answer — time-based cohorts for a season.

Pausing Airtable custom use over Mochi instead.

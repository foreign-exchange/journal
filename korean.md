# Learning Korean 

A running journal of reflections while learning/relearning Korean.

- Keep chipping away. Little by little.

- Been a minute since I practiced Korean. Life "aka new kid". Trying to ease myself back in with baby steps: 
   - Reconnect with why I study Korean
   - Booking a few iTalki lessons with tutors as a forcing function to practice
   - Watching a few easy TTMIK videos on Youtube just for fun 
   - 
- I want to make sure that I don't burnout in my attempt to get back into a flow
- [Watch this video before you speak in Korean - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXhvTPXcCV4). Great ideas on how to warm up [your brain] on Korean because the context switch costing of jumping straight into talking with someone else can be very high.
   -  Pronunciation warm-up
   -  Setence reading
   -  Paragraphy reading
   -  Answering question

- Learning quotations in Korean 
   -  In quoted sentences, the “quoted” part gets conjugated into the plain (or “diary”) form. 
   -  Then you append with `고`
   -  Can conjugate 
     -  the quoted form to indicate the tense of the quote
     -  the ending to indicate when the quote was spoken said
   -  Can use ~에게/한테/께 to the person being spoken to
   -  Can shorten 말하다 → 하다 since it's implied that this is being spoken

- More thoughts on why language learning community is challenging 
  -  Appropriate mix of levels (otherwise blind leading the bling) 
  -  Connecting over more than just dogma (the challenge of communities built around language learning methods — the approach versus the goal)
  -  Lack of accessible content in the domains, subcultures you care about

- Getting into rhythm with iTalki tutors have been great. It's given me something interactive and something to look it forward to in a way that's more than just focusing on immersion on and input

- Finding / creating a (Korean language learning) community is hard. 

### 2022 Jul 09 

Reminded of the importance to remember the vision when language learning. It's easy to get discouraged, distracted and it's importance to have something to hold onto, to movitate you to keep going when you're just grinding. Still looking for the best format to document my vision. To be continued.

Two places where I need to be mindful when learning languages — getting caught in theory / dogma and tools. [[Sometimes]] these two overlap. 

You end up learning about learning versus learning the language itself. How to best manage this? 

- Philosophy? → Keep fundamental principles in mind but be wary of the anyone who preaches their process too much (or brands it)
- Tools?  → Know your basic needs of a language learning tools and stick with tools that are light, flexible. Be careful of those that have incredible high learning curves or offer so many degrees of freedom that they are no longer opinionated (they are confused).

How to build a language learning community. Start a thread on this on twitter. Some of the challenges that I see (language level, motivation, interests), durability.

Answer — time-based cohorts for a season.
